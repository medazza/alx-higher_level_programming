# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## What's an Interactive Test?

An interactive test is a form of testing where you interact with your code or application in real-time to verify its functionality. Unlike automated tests, which are predefined and run automatically, interactive tests involve manual exploration and validation of various scenarios to ensure that your code behaves as expected. Interactive tests can be particularly useful for uncovering unexpected issues and understanding the user experience.

## Why Tests Are Important

Tests play a critical role in software development for several reasons:

1. **Verification of Functionality**: Tests help confirm that your code or application performs its intended tasks correctly.

2. **Regression Detection**: They act as a safety net to catch regressions when making changes to your codebase, ensuring that new features or fixes don't introduce new issues.

3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation, providing insights into how different parts of your code should be used.

4. **Collaboration**: Tests enable collaboration among team members by defining expected behavior and interfaces.

5. **Code Confidence**: Writing tests gives you confidence in the stability and reliability of your code.

## How to Write Docstrings to Create Tests

Docstrings are used to document your code, but they can also serve as a basis for creating tests. To write effective tests using docstrings:

1. **Describe the Test Scenario**: In the docstring, clearly describe the scenario you are testing. What inputs or conditions are being tested?

2. **Specify Expected Outcomes**: Document the expected outcomes or results of the test. What should the code produce in response to the given inputs?

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases, unusual inputs, or error conditions that should also be documented and tested.

4. **Usage Examples**: Include usage examples that demonstrate how to use the code and its expected behavior.

## How to Write Documentation for Each Module and Function

Documenting modules and functions is essential for code maintainability and collaboration. To create documentation for modules and functions:

1. **Module Documentation**:
   - Provide a high-level overview of the module's purpose and functionality.
   - List and describe any public functions or classes within the module.
   - Include usage examples if applicable.

2. **Function/Method Documentation**:
   - Describe the purpose and behavior of the function.
   - Document parameters, their types, and their significance.
   - Specify the return type and what the function returns.
   - Include usage examples demonstrating how to use the function.

3. **Docstring Conventions**: Follow a consistent docstring format, such as Google-style or reStructuredText, to make your documentation easy to understand.

## What Are the Basic Option Flags to Create Tests

When creating tests, you often use testing frameworks or libraries that provide various options and flags to customize your testing environment. Common option flags include:

1. **-v or --verbose**: Increases the verbosity of test output, providing more detailed information about test execution.

2. **-k or --keyword**: Runs only tests with names matching a specified keyword or pattern.

3. **-x or --exitfirst**: Stops test execution on the first failure, allowing you to focus on fixing one issue at a time.

4. **-m or --markers**: Filters tests based on custom markers or attributes, helping organize and categorize tests.

5. **-s or --nocapture**: Prevents capturing of standard output, allowing you to see print statements and logs during test execution.

6. **--fixtures**: Displays information about available fixtures, which are reusable testing components or resources.

## How to Find Edge Cases

Finding edge cases is crucial for thorough testing. Here are some strategies to identify edge cases:

1. **Boundary Analysis**: Identify input values at the boundaries of acceptable ranges or constraints.

2. **Invalid Inputs**: Consider what happens when you provide invalid or unexpected inputs, such as negative numbers, empty strings, or null values.

3. **Extreme Values**: Test with extreme or maximum values that could stress your code or trigger exceptional behavior.

4. **Corner Cases**: Explore scenarios where multiple edge conditions intersect or interact in complex ways.

5. **Combinations**: Test various combinations of inputs if your code depends on multiple factors.

6. **Negative Testing**: Verify how your code handles situations where things go wrong, such as network failures or resource shortages.

7. **Use Real Data**: If possible, use real-world data or sample data that reflects the actual usage of your application.
